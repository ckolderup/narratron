## What is it?

From the front page: 
 > Narratron is a web-based implementation of the Exquisite Corpse technique for writing stories. Find a story, either by checking out today's public story or by being linked to it by a group participating in making their own, and you'll be shown one of the most recent sentences written in that story—but nothing before that.  
<br>
 > Try to figure out what sentence should come next, send that in, and then follow the story along as it goes. Together we'll make something weird and wonderful.  

## How does it work?

This is my first Rails app so I'm still working out all the Rails-y specifics, but here's what I know to tell you:

 * Ruby 2.1.2
 * Rails 4.1.1
 * Using rbenv and bundler
 * postgresql in development and production

## Got all the stuff! How do I run it?

 * run `bundle install` to install all the gem dependencies.
 * run `bundle exec rake db:create` and `bundle exec rake db:migrate` to get your db set up
 * run `bundle exec foreman start` to start unicorn.

## Can I help?

Probably! If you spot anything small that needs fixing, you're welcome to send a pull request. For anything bigger I'd love to discuss it first—feel free to get in touch with me and we can chat.
